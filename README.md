# Music Releases
This project is the first we are doing in React. The project was performed in pairs and we did both pair-programming with driver/navigator and branches. We used data.json and sent data as props to components.
The project was build together with @Goncalocv 

## The problem

The design for the project was decided so we started to do structure the project and divided it in smaller components.
When we had a clear idea of how to structure the project we started to console.log the data to see which endpoints we would need for the project. We started with the App.js and continued to build the componentents from there. In the end we did the styling.
